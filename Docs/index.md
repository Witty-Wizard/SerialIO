SerialIO is a common library designed to simplify the implementation of RC protocol decoding in Arduino projects. It provides a modular and extensible architecture that allows for easy integration of various RC protocols.

# Supported Protocol

- [Futaba SBUS protocol](#sbusintro)
- [Crossfire RC protocol](#crsfintro)

## SBUS {#sbusintro}

The SBUS (Serial Bus) protocol is a digital communication protocol commonly used in radio-controlled (RC) systems for transmitting control signals between transmitters and receivers.

### Configuration

- Baud rate: 100000
- Data bits: 8 Bits
- Parity: Even Parity
- Stop bits: 2 Stop bits
- Signal polarity: Inverted

## CRSF {#crsfintro}

CRSF (Crossfire Serial Protocol) is a digital communication protocol designed for radio-controlled (RC) systems.

### Configuration

- Baud rate: 420000
- Data bits: 8 Bits
- Parity: No Parity
- Stop bits: 1 Stop bits
- Signal polarity: Uninverted

# Installation {#installation}

## Arduino Installation

To use the SerialIO library in your Arduino projects, follow these installation steps:

1. Download the SerialIO library from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Witty-Wizard/SerialIO).
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file.
3. Copy the extracted folder to the `libraries` directory in your Arduino sketchbook.
4. Restart the Arduino IDE.
5. You should now be able to include the SerialIO library in your Arduino sketches.

## PlatformIO Installation

If you are using PlatformIO, you can install the SerialIO library directly from the PlatformIO Library Manager. Add the following line to your `platformio.ini` file:

```ini
lib_deps = Witty-Wizard/SerialIO @ ^0.0.3
```

# Tutorial {#tutorial}

To use the library for decoding RC protocols in your Arduino project, follow these steps:

1. **Include Necessary Libraries**:
   Include the required libraries at the beginning of your sketch:
   ```cpp
   #include <crsf.h>
   #include <sbus.h>
   #include <serialIO.h>
   ```
2. **Define Channel Data Structure**:
   Define a structure to hold the decoded RC channel data.
   ```cpp
   crsf_channels_t channelData;
   ```
3. **Instantiate SerialIO Object**:
   Create an instance of the serialIO class, specifying the serial port, RX pin, and TX pin:
   ```cpp
   serialIO *receiver = new crsf(Serial1, pinRX, pinTX);
   ```
4. **Initialize Communication**:
   Call the begin() method to initialize communication with the specified serial port:
   ```cpp
   void setup() {
       receiver->begin();
   }
   ```

5. **Process Incoming Data**:
In the loop() function, call the processIncoming() method to process incoming bytes:

    ```cpp
    receiver->processIncoming();
    ```
6. **Retrieve Channel Data**:
To retrieve the decoded RC channel data, call the getChannel() method, passing a pointer to the channelData structure:

    ```cpp
        receiver->getChannel(&channelData);
    ```

    - @ref sbus
    - @ref crsf

## SBUS Basic Example

# Guide to Adding More Protocols

## Steps
To add more protocols to your project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Protocol File** : Start by creating a new header file for each additional protocol you want to add. For example, if you want to add a protocol named "XYZ", create a file named `xyz_protocol.h`.

2. **Define Protocol Structure** : In the protocol header file (`xyz_protocol.h`), define the structure of the protocol, including any necessary constants, data structures, and functions.

3. **Implement Protocol Functions** : Implement the protocol functions in a corresponding source file (`xyz_protocol.cpp`). These functions should handle initializing the protocol, processing incoming data, and extracting channel information.

4. **Include Protocol Header** : In your main project files or wherever you want to use the protocol, include the header file of the protocol you've created (`#include "xyz_protocol.h"`).

5. **Initialize Protocol** : Initialize the protocol in your code by calling the initialization function provided by the protocol implementation.

6. **Process Incoming Data** : Call the function to process incoming data from the protocol whenever data is received.

7. **Extract Channel Information** : Use the provided function to extract channel information from the received data, if applicable.

## Basic Functions Required

For initializing the header of a new protocol, you'll typically need the following basic functions:

- `void begin()` : Initializes the protocol, sets up necessary parameters, and prepares for data reception.
- `void processIncoming()`: Processes incoming data from the protocol, including parsing and interpreting the received data.
- `void getChannels()`: Extracts channel information from the received data, if the protocol deals with channel data.

Here's a basic template for the header of a new protocol:

```cpp
#pragma once
#ifndef XYZ_PROTOCOL_H
#define XYZ_PROTOCOL_H

// Include any necessary headers
#include <Arduino.h>

// Define any constants or data structures specific to the protocol

class XYZProtocol : public serialIO {
public:
  explicit XYZProtocol(HardwareSerial &rxPort, int rxPin, int txPin,
                       bool inverted = false)
      : serialIO(&rxPort, rxPin, txPin, inverted){};
  ;
  ~XYZProtocol();

  void begin();
  void processIncoming();
  void getChannel(/* Parameters as needed */);

private:
  HardwareSerial *_serialPort;
  // Add any additional private members as needed
};

#endif // XYZ_PROTOCOL_H
```
