# SerialIO Library

A versatile Arduino library that provides support for decoding multiple RC protocols such as SBUS and CRSF.

## Overview

SerialIO is a common library designed to simplify the implementation of RC protocol decoding in Arduino projects. It provides a modular and extensible architecture that allows for easy integration of various RC protocols.

## Supported Protocols

- **SBUS**: Futaba SBUS protocol.
- **CRSF**: Crossfire RC protocol.

## Installation

To use the SerialIO library in your Arduino projects, follow these installation steps:

1. Install the library directly from PlatformIO by adding the following line to your `platformio.ini` file:

   ```ini
   lib_deps = Witty-Wizard/SerialIO @ ^0.0.2
   ```
